# Kolmo
A research-driven system that unifies physics-informed machine learning, statistical estimation, sensor fusion, and stochastic analysis to form a mathematically robust framework for real-time modelling of dynamical systems under uncertainty.

Grounded in the probabilistic legacy of Kolmogorov, Kolmo bridges the gap between learned and physical models, enabling predictive inference in noisy, high-dimensional environments.
