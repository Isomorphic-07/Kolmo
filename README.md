# ðŸŒŒ Kolmo

> *"In the spirit of Kolmogorov, we unify the probabilistic foundations of learning with the structure of the physical world."*

**Kolmo** is a research-driven system that integrates **physics-informed machine learning**, **statistical estimation**, **sensor fusion**, and **stochastic analysis** into a mathematically principled framework for **real-time modelling of dynamical systems under uncertainty**.

Grounded in the probabilistic legacy of **Andrey Kolmogorov**, Kolmo bridges the gap between **learned models** and **physical laws**, enabling predictive inference in **noisy**, **high-dimensional**, and **partially observable** environments.
